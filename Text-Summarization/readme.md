# Text Summarization using BART

This repository contains code for performing text summarization using the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model.
Text summarization is the process of creating shorter text without removing the semantic structure of the original text.

## Usage

The code demonstrates how to perform text summarization using BART in PySpark. Here's a brief overview:

1. Import necessary libraries and start Spark session.
2. Define a Spark NLP pipeline with components including `DocumentAssembler` and `BartTransformer`.
3. Download the pre-trained BART model.
4. Set the task for summarization.
5. Provide input text for summarization.
6. Fit the pipeline model on the input data.
7. Transform the input data to obtain summarized output.

## Example

The code provided in this repository illustrates how to implement the above steps to summarize a piece of text. It utilizes Spark NLP and PySpark for efficient text processing and utilizes the pre-trained BART model for text summarization.

## Result

The summarized text provides a concise representation of the input text while retaining its semantic meaning.
