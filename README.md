# Natural Language Processing Projects Repository

Welcome to the Natural Language Processing Projects Repository! This repository contains projects focused on various aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each project explores a specific NLP task, providing implementations, resources, and insights into its application.

## Folders:

1. **Healthcare NLP:**
   - This folder contains projects related to the application of NLP in healthcare, including tasks such as clinical text analysis, medical document classification, and more.

2. **NLU (Natural Language Understanding):**
   - Explore projects centered around natural language understanding, covering tasks like sentiment analysis, intent classification, and semantic parsing.

3. **Named Entity Recognition:**
   - Dive into projects focusing on named entity recognition (NER), a crucial task in NLP aimed at identifying and categorizing entities mentioned in text, such as names of people, organizations, locations, and more.

4. **Text Summarization:**
   - Discover projects dedicated to text summarization, where the goal is to condense large pieces of text into concise summaries while preserving the key information and meaning.

5. **Topic Modeling:**
   - Explore projects related to topic modeling, a technique used to discover abstract topics within a collection of documents. These projects may include implementations of algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).
