# Topic Modeling with PySpark

This repository contains code for performing topic modeling on textual data using PySpark. 
Topic modeling is a technique used to uncover latent topics within a collection of documents.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **PySpark**: PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, an open-source distributed computing system.
- **Spark NLP**: Spark NLP is a natural language processing library for Apache Spark.

## Overview

The code demonstrates how to perform topic modeling using PySpark. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. **Data Loading**: The input textual data is loaded into a PySpark DataFrame.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: A natural language processing (NLP) pipeline is constructed for preprocessing the text data. This involves tasks such as tokenization, normalization, and stop word removal.
3. **Feature Engineering**: The tokenized text data is converted into numerical feature vectors using the CountVectorizer algorithm. This step prepares the data for input into the topic modeling algorithm.
4. **Topic Modeling**: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is applied to the feature vectors to uncover latent topics within the text corpus.
5. **Result Visualization**: The resulting topics, along with their associated words, are displayed for interpretation.

## Example

The code provided in this repository illustrates how to implement the above steps to perform topic modeling on a dataset of comments. It utilizes PySpark and Spark NLP for efficient text processing and topic modeling.

## Result

The output of the topic modeling process is a set of topics, each represented by a list of words. These topics provide insights into the thematic structure of the text corpus.
